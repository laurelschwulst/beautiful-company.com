beautiful-company.com
======================
This website is for my personal design practice. It tries to be a complete archive, even if not everything is visible all the time. It shows that I work under multiple identities while I do design: Beautiful Company (my design name), Linked by Air (amazing small studio in NYC I worked at), and Laurel Schwulst (my real name).


### Colophon

Design and programming is by [Beautiful Company](http://beautiful-company.com).

The site is built on [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/).

### Installation

After downloading, add a new folder “content” to the root directory. Inside “content”, add two new empty folders: “error” and “home”.

I like to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info) to locally run PHP. If you use MAMP, place folder in MAMP’s “htldocs” folder. Navigate to /panel and you should be on your way.
